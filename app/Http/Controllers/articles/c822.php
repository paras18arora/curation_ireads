			<p>In C printf(), %n is a special format specifier which instead of printing something causes printf() to load the variable pointed by the  corresponding argument with a value equal to the number of characters that have been printed by printf() before the occurrence of %n.<span id="more-8608"></span></p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int c;
  printf("geeks for %ngeeks ", &c);
  printf("%d", c);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The above program prints "geeks for geeks 10â€³. The first printf() prints "geeks for geeks".  The second printf() prints 10 as there are 10 characters printed (the 10 characters are "geeks for ") before %n in first printf() and c is set to 10 by first printf().</p>

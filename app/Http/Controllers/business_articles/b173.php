					<p>Film director, screenwriter and producer Christopher Nolan is regarded as one of the most successful filmmakers of the 21st century. His nine films have grossed more than $4.2 billion worldwide, earning him a spot as one of the highest-grossing directors in history.</p><p>As Nolan reflects on his own creative process, he notes, "Every film you want to be challenging yourself, you want to do something different."</p><p>In the video above, entrepreneurial guru Evan Carmichael elaborates on this idea, and he explains why challenging yourself is especially important after already having found success. Repeating a process will simply not yield duplicate results in a business world that is constantly changing.

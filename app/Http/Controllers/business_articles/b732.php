	<p>I met today’s guest over 6 years ago when we were both young and learning about how to run businesses. The difference was that he already had a growing company with a handful of employees.</p><p>But neither of us could have known how big it would become.</p><p>Ryan Holmes is the founder of the social media tech company Hootsuite. It is now almost 1000 employees big and a major player in the online business space.</p><p>I stayed with Ryan in Vancouver when we were both attending ManTalks recently and finally got him on <a>The School of Greatness</a>.</p><p>I’m glad it took me so long to have him on the show because I was able to get amazing perspective from him about how he has grown his businesses.</p><p>Ryan has a huge heart, is deeply sincere, and has a great mind for business and entrepreneurship. So I had lots of questions for him.</p><p>But of course it wasn’t all business focused. We also got into the hardest experiences of his life and how they have shaped him.</p><p>Be sure to take notes on Ryan’s advice for young entrepreneurs as you listen to Episode 321.</p><p><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/262422075&color=358cb4" width="100%"></iframe></p><p>Subscribe on <a style="border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out; color: rgb(53, 140, 180); font-family: DroidSerif, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">iTunes</a>, <a style="border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out; color: rgb(53, 140, 180); font-family: DroidSerif, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Stitcher Radio</a>, <a style="border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out; color: rgb(53, 140, 180); font-family: DroidSerif, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Google Play</a> or <a style="border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out; color: rgb(53, 140, 180); font-family: DroidSerif, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">TuneIn</a>.</p><h2>Some questions I ask:</h2><ul><li>If you could only ask one question for every new hire you interviewed, what would it be?</li><li>How important is your personal health to the success of your company?</li><li>What would your one piece of advice be for young entrepreneurs to succeed? </li></ul><h2>In This Episode, You Will Learn:</h2><ul><li>How to build a team that does all the stuff you don’t want to do</li><li>The rule of 10 when it comes to management and scaling</li><li>What Ryan learned from his near-death paragliding accident</li><li>The massive impact of Millennials in the workforce</li><li>The difference between good hustle and bad hustle</li></ul>

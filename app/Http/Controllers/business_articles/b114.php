					<p>In this video, bestselling author <a>Al Pittampalli</a> sits down with <a>Behind the Brand</a> host Bryan Elliott to discuss his new book, <em><a>Persuadable: How Great Leaders Change Their Minds to Change the World</a></em> -- a combination of research and storytelling to help company leaders realize the power of effectively persuading others in an ever-changing business world. </p><p>In contrast to his first book, <em><a>Read This Before Our Next Meeting: The Modern Meeting Standard for Successful Organizations</a>, </em>which was about decisive leadership and the death of the concept of old-school meetings, he says<em> <a>Persuadable</a> </em>is quite the opposite. </p><p>"When I was working in the corporate world, I had these leaders that I didn't think were managing me the right way, they weren't steering the boat the way I thought they needed to," says Pittampalli, who started his career as an IT consultant for Ernst & Young where he advised Fortune 500 organizations all over the country. "So I started to look into leadership, really the academics -- what works and what doesn't work."</p><p>He says that one of the big things that mondern-day leaders get wrong is the constant pursuit of confidence.</p><p>"Everyone want to be more confident, more certain about their ideas, they want to show up to that meeting and say, 'This is the right way to go,'" he says. "Even thought that looks good, that is not the path to leadership success, because in a world that is changing faster than ever, it's actually keeping our confidence in check -- realizing that we can't know all the answers. And that's kind of the foundation for good decision-making."</p><p>Click play to learn more about the dynamics of great leadership from this noted expert. </p><p></p><p><em><a style="text-decoration: underline; box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;">Entrepreneur Network</a></em> <em>is a <a>premium video network</a> providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders. We provide expertise and opportunities to accelerate brand growth and effectively monetize video and audio content distributed across all digital platforms for the business genre.</em></p><p><em>EN is partnered with hundreds of top <a>YouTube channels</a> in the business vertical and provides partners with distribution on <a>Entrepreneur.com</a> as well as our apps on Amazon Prime, Roku and Apple TV.</em></p><p><em> to become a part of this growing video network.</em></p>

	<p>Napster, Dropbox, Kinko’s, Facebook, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Dell, Google, Reddit, Snapchat, Wordpress.</p><p>What do these companies have in common?</p><p>Yes, they are all incredibly successful, but there is an even starker connection. They were all started by college students.</p><p>It’s no secret that higher education is commonplace for young entrepreneurs, but in an era where the approximate balance of the nation’s student loans is growing by <a>$2,762.27 a second</a>, potential entrepreneurs could be holding back from pursuing their business ideas.</p><p></p><p>At this year’s Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) America 2016 meeting, former President Bill Clinton and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute President Shirley Ann Jackson discussed just that -- the connection between America’s entrepreneurial future and the $1.2 trillion Americans hold in student loan debt.</p><p>Students have <a>broad access to entrepreneurship in higher education</a>, but perhaps don’t have the means to actually apply those teachings to business opportunities. <a>Studies</a> show that college-educated adults who graduated with no student debt have seven times the average net worth of a young adult that graduates college with debt.</p><p>Clinton suggests the problem lies in the structure of the student loan process.</p><p>“A college loan is the only loan you cannot refinance, which I think is insane,” he says. “Your education is more of a lifetime asset than any home you’ll ever own.”</p><p></p><p>This is a roadblock, more often than not, for minorities.</p><p>More than 40 percent of African-American families have student debt, generally taking on around $10,295, according to a 2013 <a>study by the Urban Institute</a>. Twenty-eight percent of white families held debt, averaging $8,020.</p><p>Women are also taking longer to pay off student debt, according to a <a>report</a> completed this year by the American Association of University Women, despite being <a>more likely to enroll </a>and earning <a>higher grades</a> than most of their male peers.</p><p>Jackson suggests “a progressive kind of approach” to the problem, proposing partial loan forgiveness for those who start a business.</p><p>“Rewarding individuals for contributions to the private sector isn’t unprecedented”, Jackson says, referring to the <a>EB-5 immigrant investor program</a>, which is similar.</p><p>The speakers also said that young adults may be going to college even when they don’t need to, accumulating unnecessary debt.</p><p>“We need to re-dignify skills training in this country," Clinton says. "It’s absolutely true that not everyone needs a college degree.”</p>

	<p>For years, I dreamed of the day when I would tell my employer I was tired and done, and leaving for a dream work situation. This was just my dream until I took action to make it reality. It took two-and-a-half years, but I quit and now live a life I mostly love.</p><p>Many people risk turning their dream into a nightmare by prematurely quitting a job they hate. Quitting without a plan is not a place of strength. Before you quit your job, make sure you have a foundation of these four things.</p><h2></h2><p>The stats on Americans and emergency funds are scary. Most emergencies would wipe the average person out. If you are thinking about quitting a job, the emergency fund should be even larger than the standard. Have an emergency fund that withstands the income inconsistency of starting a business -- especially a lifestyle business.</p><p>There is no magic number but be prepared. A strong mindset is important, but don’t ignore common sense. Have something to fall back on.</p><p></p><h2></h2><p>Making a couple of bucks for a few months isn’t a proven lifestyle business. This kind of business is a roller coaster ride until you know what you are doing. You can make a lot of money quickly, then nothing the next month.</p><p>Don't quit before your lifestyle business has made money for more than just a few months and you have multiple streams (or at least trickles) of income you can grow. Depending on any one thing for your income leaves you in a bad place when that one thing vanishes. Let your lifestyle business prove itself before you quit your job.</p><p></p><h2></h2><p>In addition to already making money, you need a plan to grow the dream. What works today may not work tomorrow. You need to be diverse and think of your business as a business. Spend some time planning marketing strategies that will bring new business. Spend time planning how you can diversify your income even more.</p><p></p><h2></h2><p>You work very hard  building your dream on the side while you work a fulltime job. You need that same work ethic when you are living the dream. When you are tired and frustrated by the journey, take a break. Regroup and re-plan, but never get lazy.</p><p>Life would be great if everything worked out just like it does in the movies, but that’s not a reality. You have to be smart before you do something that could ruin your life or the life of your family. Put a strong foundation in place before quitting your job to work your dream. It took years, but I did it. You can, too.</p>

	<p>It’s easy to have a goal in mind. It’s harder to follow through. But, getting your motivation in gear, even when you're not feeling it, can make the difference between those who <em>wish</em> they were successful versus those who <em>are</em> successful. </p>

<p>I don’t find many people otherwise doing that, and it’s something I’ve taken to,” he tells. “In every meeting I go to, I carry  a notebook around and take notes. It helps me remember to follow up and I don’t forget what was discussed when I refer back later.”</p>

<p>“I use <a>Google calendar</a>,” he says. “I create different calendars and put them in different views. I have a work calendar, a personal calendar and a to-do calendar. That’s a way for me to actually have one place to look, especially the do-to vs. the events in one place. If you put the to-do into a calendar event it confuses everyone else because they think it’s busy time, which is why it’s important to have that separate calendar.”</p>

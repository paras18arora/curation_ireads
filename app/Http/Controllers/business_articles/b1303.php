	<p>The gourmet-burger chain founded by the Wahlberg brothers is rapidly expanding.</p>
<p>The Boston-based chain, called Wahlburgers, has signed agreements with five franchise groups to open 30 new restaurants in seven states: Massachusetts, California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Carolina, the company told <em>Business Insider.</em></p>
<p>Today the chain has only seven open restaurants.</p>
<p>The new agreements bring the total number of restaurants set to open over the five to seven years to 118, Wahlburgers CEO Rick Vanzura told Business Insider in an interview.</p>
<p>The cities that will get Wahlburger locations include: Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia; Los Angeles; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cleveland; Detroit; Charleston and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and greater San Francisco. The company has also made previous agreements to open in Manhattan, Orlando, Philadelphia, Long Island, and Washington, D.C.</p>

	<p>Wahlburgers is competing with other better-burger chains such as Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smashburger.</p>
<p>But it has a unique advantage over those chains: Wahlburgers is the subject of an Emmy-nominated reality-TV show, which was recently approved for two more 14-episode seasons on A&E.</p>

	<p>Opening a restaurant might seem like an odd choice for Mark and Donnie Wahlberg, who are best known for their acting and singing.</p>
<p>But the lesser-known Wahlberg brother -- Paul -- is a classically trained chef who has been in the restaurant industry for more than 30 years.</p>

	<p>The privately held company doesn't release many details about its financials. Vanzura said the original Wahlburgers location generated about $5 million in sales annually, but he noted that he would not expect that volume for every restaurant going forward.</p>
<p>By comparison, Shake Shack's 41 company-owned restaurants generate about $5.4 million annually, company filings show. Shake Shack, which went public last year, has a market value of about $1.5 billion.</p>

	<p>The average ticket at Wahlburgers restaurants is roughly $14 to $15 a person for a drink, side dish, and burger, with tax.</p>
<p>The restaurants feature a full bar with craft beer, wine, and liquor, and menu items such as the O.F.D -- a half-pound beef burger with house-made tomato jam, bacon, Swiss cheese, and sautéed mushrooms -- and sandwiches like the crispy haddock, which features seasoned panko-breaded haddock fillets topped with lettuce, tomato, and balsamic tartar sauce.</p>

	<p>The menu also has turkey burgers, chicken sandwiches, and a range of made-to-order salads. Sides include classic or sweet-potato fries, tater tots, onion rings, chili, and macaroni salad.</p>
<p>As at Five Guys and Shake Shack, Wahlburgers customers can order their food at a register and pick it up at the counter. But Wahlburgers also offers full table service, and it puts a strong emphasis on dining in.</p>

	<p>Vanzura says the company is still looking for franchisee groups to open additional locations.</p>
<p>The company, however, isn't accepting any individual franchisees; it's looking only for franchisee groups that can open multiple restaurants in any given territory.</p>
<p>"We're looking for people who have well-established experience in the restaurant business," Vanzura said.</p>

	<p>Elon Musk visited the Pentagon yesterday, and he wasn’t there to join a <a>super secret boy band</a>. Yeah, we’re bummed, too.</p><p>Turns out, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX might’ve been at the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense for a top-secret <em>tête-à-tête</em> about flying metal suits. Or not. Depends on what level of security clearance the futurist dude has, and whether we’re really living in <a style="text-decoration:none;"><em>The Matrix</em></a>, like he suspects we might be.  </p><p>Kidding aside, Musk really did swing by the Pentagon Wednesday and everyone’s scratching their heads trying to nail down exactly why, <em>CNN </em>reporter Ryan Browne<em> </em>included. Browne published <a>this story</a> on the mysterious pitstop, in which he spills what little is known about closed-door meeting about “innovation” between Musk and the U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.   </p><p></p><p>The government remains mum about the meeting, apart from Department of Defense spokesperson Peter Cook acknowledging that Carter “has been reaching out to a number of members of the technology community to get their ideas, their feedback, find out what’s going on in the world of innovation.”</p><p>Being that we’re talking Mr. Musk here, innovation could refer to anything from <a style="text-decoration:none;">artificial intelligence</a> to <a style="text-decoration:none;">vacuum-tube transportation</a> to electric jets to colonizing mars. Who knows? He might’ve met with Uncle Sam to discuss the landmark <a>$82.7 million SpaceX contract</a> he recently inked to blast a U.S. Air Force GPS satellite into orbit by 2018. All that, after <a>suing</a> the military entity.</p><p>It’s anyone’s guess. Or is it? The man, the myth, the legend himself tweeted out a hint about the Pentagon meeting, just to keep us guessing:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p>Something about a flying metal suit...<a>https://t.co/6Z1D9iZ1fV</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a>June 9, 2016</a></blockquote><p></p><p>Don’t strain your brain thinking too hard about it. There’s a “<a style="text-decoration:none;">one in billions</a>” chance we’re not living in a fake world anyway.  </p><p>Just for fun, check out these reply tweets to Tony Stark's, er, we mean Musk’s tease-tweet about his hush-hush trip to the Pentagon:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p><a>@elonmusk</a> First leaked photos!!! <a>pic.twitter.com/mbqKVECfoz</a></p>— João Pacheco (@JoaoPacheco91) <a>June 9, 2016</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p><a>@elonmusk</a> I hope you don't help with the "weapons".

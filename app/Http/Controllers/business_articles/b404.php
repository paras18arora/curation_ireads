					<p>In this video, Entrepreneur Network partner <a>C1 Revolution</a> features photographer <a>Nathan Michael</a>, who has made a career out of creating unique and visually stimulating images for brands. His approach is a combination of art meets science and has been accelerated by the rise of social media -- namely, <a>Instagram</a>. He started <a>Beef Bureau</a> in Chicago to meet the demand for his work and opened up <a>Low Res Studio</a> to grow his team.</p><p>At Beef Bureau, he creates monthly installments of content for brands that they can use on social media every day. So what's made Beef Bureau stand out?</p><p>"We're very much focused on creating beautiful imagery we feel connects with people and has a style to it and can engage the brands in the direction that they're wanting to take," he says. "We understand why culture likes certain things and why they gravitate toward things."</p><p>Michael says that he does look at numbers to decide what images to use, but he doesn't measure everything by pure data.</p><p>"We look at it as art meets science," he says. "I think there is a sweet spot and balance."</p><p></p><p><em>The <a>Entrepreneur Network</a> is a global movement of creative, energetic and inspired video creators sharing their ideas, experience and vision for the next generation of business founders and owners. We provide expertise and opportunities to accelerate brand growth and effectively monetize video and audio content distributed across all digital platforms for the business genre.</em></p><p><em> to become a part of this growing video network.</em></p>

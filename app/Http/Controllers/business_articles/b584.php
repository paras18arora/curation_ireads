	<p>Getting the right mentoring at the right time can do wonders for any startup just beginning their journey. And imagine what would happen when this mentoring is given by multinational computer technology corporation Oracle.</p><p>Announced in April, Oracle Startup Cloud Accelerator will be a platform for startups to help them grow by providing technology, mentoring, go-to-market strategy, investors, working space, and more.

It presents the user with choices that maximises the probability (Expectation) of a favorable action (say a buy). Since it takes into account, not only the user behavior, but also the behaviors of the device, widgets, it optimizes the end goal leaving behind traditional algorithms like collaborative filtering and content based filtering.</p><h3>Niyo Solutions</h3><p>This FinTech startup founded by Virender Bisht and Vijay Nagri is disrupting the consumer banking experience at a global level with its innovative and market first solutions. The startup aims to provide alternate payment mechanisms.</p><p>Keeping the startup in stealth mode, the official launch will be in January next year.

The big data streaming through these devices is then used to power algorithms and generate actionable insights.

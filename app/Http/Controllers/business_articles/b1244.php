	<p>Travel Leaders has quite the windy past.</p><p>Its beginning can be traced back to 1872 when Georges Nagelmackers’ Compagnie des Wagons-Lits installed luxury-sleeping compartments in European trains.

Foster founded Ask Mr. Foster, a travel agency based in St. Augustine, Fla.</p><p>As each expanded, Carlson Companies Inc. purchased Ask Mr. Foster in 1979 evolving into Carlson Travel Network, which eventually merged with Wagonlit Travel in 1997. It officially franchised in 1984.</p>In 2008, that company joined with Travel Leaders and Tzell Travel Group to form what is known today as the Travel Leaders franchise, offering travel agencies and booking services across the country. The company’s long past helped it nab the 124th spot on <em>Entrepreneur’s </em><a>Franchise 500</a> for 2016.

					</div>
	
	<p>You may have seen Cornwell Quality Tools in your neighborhood. Driving around in white trucks, the franchise is one of the few mobile sellers of tools.</p><p>The company got its start thanks to founder Eugene Cornwell in Ohio in 1919.

			Snap-on Tools | Facebook

							</a>
					</div>
	
	<p>Started in 1920, the founders of Snap-on saw a huge issue in the tool market: wrenches that could only do one job. So, Joseph Johnson and William Seidemann set out to manufacturer sockets that could "snap on" different wrench handles. One tool could now do the work of five.</p><p>The concept took off and today, Snap-on offers customers much more than wrenches. Becoming a franchise in 1991, the company has more than 22,000 products, including power tools, shop equipment and hand tools. About once a week, franchisees will bring their “mobile stores” to customers -- car dealerships and mechanics, to name a few.   </p>It has earned the 22nd spot on Entrepreneur’s <a>Franchise 500 list</a>for 2016.

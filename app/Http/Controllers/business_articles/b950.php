	<p><em>This article originally published on September 26, 2015.</em></p><p>When Daymond John was in elementary school in Queens, N.Y., he had to read books <a>four times over</a> to retain what they said. Now, at 46, he says he still has to reread them several times -- often two to three times each -- for the information to really sink in.</p><p>The sharp-dressed <em>Shark Tank</em> star and veteran investor/entrepreneur doesn’t habitually reread books as a result of being too busy or distracted the first go-round. He chalks it up to being dyslexic, something he only discovered as an adult with the onset of texting and social media.</p><p>“Because I’m dyslexic, I’ve had to read books many times,” he says. “That’s why I focus on reading ones that are high-impact and incredibly useful, full of important lessons that I can apply to my life and business.”</p><p></p><p>Despite how challenging reading is for the multi-millionaire celebrity business mentor, he forces himself to do it regularly, soaking up pearls of wisdom from contemporary and past thought leaders and leveraging them to up his game.</p><p>We recently caught up with the Infusionsoft and Shopify brand ambassador on the Sony Pictures Culver City, Calif., set of <em>Shark Tank</em>, where we asked him which books had the greatest impact on his life and career. Remaining humble, the FUBU co-founder didn’t seize the opportunity to plug <a>his own books</a>, though he easily could have (other Sharks did). He didn’t even mention them. Instead, and without a moment to prepare ahead of time, he quickly rattled off the names and authors of six books that forever changed him and that he thinks all entrepreneurs will benefit from reading, too.</p><p>“They’re smart choices not only for hopefuls, but for seasoned business pros as well,” he says. They are:</p><h2>1. <a style="text-decoration:none;">Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!</a> by Robert Kiyosaki</h2><img alt="" src="https://assets.entrepreneur.com/article/1435181977_1427232698_1.jpg" /><div class="courtesy">Image credit: Amazon</div><p>In this step-by-step-style financial literacy classic, multi-millionaire entrepreneur and motivational speaker Robert Kiyosaki shares how he used lessons from two dads -- his own fiscally poor father and his best friend’s rich father -- to shape his opinions around money and to build his fortune.</p><p></p><h2>2. <a style="text-decoration:none;">Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant</a> by W.

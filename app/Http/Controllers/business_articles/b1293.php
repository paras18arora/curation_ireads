	<p>Jean Brodnax-Martin was running the second-largest cosmetic surgery center in the country when she decided she needed a change. She shifted from improving people’s exteriors to helping them improve their interiors, via high quality food, by opening a Vom Fass with her husband Michael.</p><p>The German franchise, which only recently expanded to the states, sells gourmet cooking oils, vinegars, wine, spirits and liqueurs. Brodnax-Martin, who loves to cook, was drawn to the company because its food and beverage products are sustainable, fair trade and come from small farms.</p><p>Read more below her franchise journey below.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20160311095922-jean-brodnax-martin-2.jpg" style="height:582px; width:814px" /></p><div class="caption">Jeannie and her husband Michael.</div><div class="courtesy">Image Credit: Frankie Rendon</div><p> Jean Brodnax-Martin</p><p> <a>Vom Fass</a> in Greenville, South Carolina</p><p></p><p><br />Nine years. In addition to opening Vom Fass in 2014, my husband and I have also operated an organic-based lawn care company since 2007.</p><p><br />We chose franchising because of the head start it gives you in opening a new business including large purchasing power, a proven system, unique or proprietary products, brand awareness and the existing marketing pool. As small business owners, this allows us to focus more on day-to-day operations.</p><p><br />I was in the healthcare field and opened the second-largest dermatologic/cosmetic surgery center in the US, located in south Florida.</p><p><br />It’s a natural fit for me because I love what this company is all about. They source only the highest-quality, fair trade and sustainable products directly from small farms. You only purchase products in the size you need and bottles are reused, so there’s no waste. I love to cook and it’s so easy to prepare a healthy meal with great flavor using our oils and vinegars. The other half of our store contains exclusive single malt scotch, Irish whiskey, brandy, cognac and other spirits.</p><p></p><p><br />Including all construction, fixtures and product, around $300,000. My annual budget consists of:  Rent ($48,000) utilities, phone and internet ($4,800), salaries, including part time and seasonal ($30,000), insurance, liability and premise ($4,000),  accounting and legal ($3,000), licenses and taxes ($3,000), public relations and advertising ($30,000) and general office software, support and supplies ($2,500).</p><p><br />I initially discovered Vom Fass in Europe years ago and fell in love. When I found out they were expanding to the U.S. market, I signed up.</p><p><br />Finding a good location as well as dealing with the federal and state liquor laws proved to be a real challenge. In South Carolina, you must have a split store, oil and vinegar on one side and spirits on the other. The spirits side can only be open Monday through Saturday and must close by 7 p.m.</p><p><br />Talk to owners with experience in different states and really do your research. Visit existing franchises that have been in business for a while to see what works.</p><p></p><p><br />The next step for us is opening a store in Charleston, followed by location in Hilton Head. We have purchased the rights to South Carolina and plan to open a total of three stores over the next few years.</p>

	<p>Minutes after successfully launching two satellites from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the Falcon 9 rocket crashed while attempting to land on an ocean barge on Wednesday. Taking to Twitter, <a>SpaceX</a> CEO <a>Elon Musk</a> reported the chain of events:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p>Ascent phase & satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a>June 15, 2016</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p>Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a>June 15, 2016</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p>RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a>June 15, 2016</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p>Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a>June 15, 2016</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a>June 15, 2016</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><em>Entrepreneur</em> will post the video as soon as it is made available. We just hope those drone pilots were wearing their seatbelts. Above is a video of the rocket's successful launch.</p><p> </p>

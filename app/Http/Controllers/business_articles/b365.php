	<p>Increased use of social media and online marketing techniques gives companies a chance to engage with their customers, and brands are quickly catching on to the practice of reputation marketing. The potential downside is that this kind of interaction means customers are also free to publish reviews, complaints and comments that may negatively affect your brand.</p><p>This is where reputation marketing comes into play. Last year at <a>Pubcon</a> search conference, I ran into Shai Aharony from <a>Reboot Online</a> that summed it up well when he said "reputation marketing tools allow you to analyze, track, monitor and engage online activity, giving you the power to directly respond to customer complaints and turn potentially damaging feedback into a positive experience."</p><p></p><p>In order to best manage your brand’s online reputation and make customer engagement a part of your marketing strategy, your team needs to have the very best tools at your disposal.</p><p>I’ve identified the top 10 tools for reputation marketing that I've used in the past so you can see a real impact as you invest more in your brand’s reputation:</p><h2>1. ConsumerAffairs</h2><p>With over 5,000 listed brands and more than a million consumer reviews, <a>ConsumerAffairs</a> offers brands some of the most diverse and advanced features to build a strong online reputation and generate increased revenue. The consumer advocacy group’s website offers free and unpaid business plans and their third-party accreditation program coupled with a powerful software as a service (SaaS) platform offers brands a variety of resources to convert customer engagement into additional revenue.</p><h2>2. BazaarVoice           </h2><p>Best for larger companies with deeper budgets, <a>BazaarVoice</a> was created to extend the online marketing potential of customers’ voices to shopping portals, offline channels and natural search. Customers are able to leave reviews, ratings, questions, answers and other customer-generated content on client websites, which BazaarVoice then shares on social media and across the internet.</p><h2>3. Better Business Bureau</h2><p>Founded in 1912, the <a>Better Business Bureau</a> (BBB) is the elder statesman of consumer reviews. The non-profit group serves as an intermediary to help resolve disputes between customers and brands, and with reviews for over 4 million companies, the BBB website is one of the most popular and trusted consumer resources available. Ideal for entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to personally interact with their customers, the BBB offers a variety of networking opportunities at a convenient price.</p><p></p><h2>4. Yotpo</h2><p>Yotpo is a powerful plug-and-play solution for ecommerce with a sleek, mobile-first design. Customers who make purchases on sites using <a>Yotpo</a> receive an email after their purchase asking them to review the product(s) they received. This Mail After Purchase (MAP) technique leads to more reviews, and since the requests go directly to the consumer, all of the reviews are automatically verified.</p><h2>5. Cision</h2><p>Unlike the previous tools that focus primarily on consumer reviews and feedback, <a>Cision</a> is a powerful public relations resource that gives brands the tools they need to get their message out. With more than 1.6 million contacts and outlets, Cision provides the perfect opportunity to connect your brand with crucial journalists, bloggers and social influencers who might otherwise be inaccessible.</p><h2>6. Percolate</h2><p>Managing all of your brand’s marketing efforts in one place is easy with software from <a>Percolate</a>, whether it’s planning campaigns, storing files, collaborating or content creation. The planner takes into account all your details, such as your target audience, brand identity guidelines and business objectives. Percolate provides a cross channel marketing calendar that helps you plan accordingly and is designed to make it easy to share content with consumers across social media, the Web and other traditional methods.</p><p></p><h2>7. Reputation Loop</h2><p>Designed to empower small business owners and allow them to expand their businesses, <a>Reputation Loop</a> is similar to Yotpo in that it works primarily by automatically contacting recent customers for reviews. But additional features like real-time reporting and review monitoring on sites like Yelp and Google+ provide valuable tools for brand managers.</p><h2>8. TinyTorch</h2><p>A social platform that helps brands build their online profile through social influencers and user-generated content (UGC), <a>TinyTorch</a> allows brands identify, monitor and manage their online presence. This platform helps find your best, most influential customers and cultivates their stories and photos to redistribute across multiple marketing channels.</p><h2>9. HootSuite</h2><p><a>HootSuite</a> is a social media management platform that allows brands to monitor and sync all of their social media accounts in one simple interface. With support for popular networks like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and more, HootSuite makes it easy to share content across multiple accounts and schedule posts in advance for blanketed marketing. From a reputation management standpoint, brands can use HootSuite to monitor customer feedback posted to their social media accounts and share positive reviews and comments across multiple social media networks simultaneously.</p><h2>10. TrustPilot</h2><p>Like other third-party review websites, <a>TrustPilot</a> allows users to leave reviews for businesses on its website, while offering both free and paid listings for brands. More than 100,000 companies are listed and more than 13 million reviews are currently available -- with more than 500,000 added each month. With its simple, easily navigated site and a basic assortment of analytics and engagement tools, TrustPilot is a good pick for businesses seeking simpler options.</p>

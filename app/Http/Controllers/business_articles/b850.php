					<p>May 16 will be an important day for entrepreneurs. That's when rules for equity crowdfunding go into effect.</p><p>In this first episode of <em>Crowdfund with Cat</em>, Alon Hillel-Tuch, a co-founder of the crowdfunding platform <a>RocketHub</a>, walks us through what equity crowdfunding is and how itâ€™s different from the more traditional donation-based crowdfunding. <a>RocketHub was acquired</a> by entrepreneurship resource center <a>EFactor</a> a year ago. Since then, Hillel-Tuch has left and is now a partner at the venture building group, <a>Stacked VB</a>.</p><p>For a deeper dive into what those May 16 rule changes are and what they mean, check out our series of written stories on equity crowdfunding (linked below). These stories get into the nitty-gritty, down-and-dirty, what you need to know for both sides of the finance relationship: entrepreneur and investor.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

					<p>Do you have the bad habit of putting off important tasks until the last minute? Would you like to kick that habit and stop procrastinating for good?</p><p>In this video, Entrepreneur Network partner and marketing expert <a>Ben Angel</a>, says that your productivity and your tendency to procrastinate are intrinsically linked to your self-image and who you want to be right now.</p><p>"Remember -- thoughts and beliefs are all self-fulfilling prophecies," he says. "Who you are and who you need to be are two different identities to get the task done. You can never out-perform your own self-image... your current identity won't allow you to reach future goals, because it doesn't believe it can -- otherwise you would have hit those goals."</p><p>So, who do you need to become to reach your current goals? Press play to learn more -- and rid yourself of procrastination forever. </p><p><em>Watch more videos from <a>Ben Angel on his YouTube channel here</a>. </em></p><p></p><p><a><em>Entrepreneur Network</em></a> <em>is a </em><a><em>premium video network</em></a><em> providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

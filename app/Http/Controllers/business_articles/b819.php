	<p>If we talk about the approach of an investor towards funding, there are three discernible trends to take note of -- firstly, with investors still looking to exit close to 70% of $50 billion worth of investments made during period 2000-08, focus is shifting from copy-cat models to sustainable models with strong unit economics. Bottom line is becoming the flavour of the season versus top line.</p><p>Secondly, with an onset of a weak funding environment, private equity and venture capital funds are adopting a more cautious approach todeal-making and are expected to spend more time on evaluating<br />opportunities. Now besidesconventional due diligence, scope maybe expanded in specificcases to include litigation history, political affiliations, unfavourable publicity, promoter background checks, and other such information unavailable in the public domain.</p><p>Thirdly, several funds are revamping their investment philosophies. On one hand, earlystage investors feel that the startup space is getting overcrowded and are looking to invest in growth-stage companies. On the other hand, many venture capital funds such as SAIF, Helion, Matrix are leaning towards early-stage deals to catch companies young as valuations of startups begin to soar in a short span of time.</p><h3>Promoters should brace themselves with tempered valuations</h3><p>VC and angel investments reached an all-time high in 2015 with approximately $5.5 billion worth of investments. However, given the first quarter deal activity, the frenzy is now slowing down and the deal environment is expected to witness a significant correction in 2016. At the backdrop of low deal activity, it is imperative that startups go back to the business fundamentals which are supported<br />by solid execution. Moreover, it is essential for promoters to take a reality check and brace themselves with tempered valuations. </p><p>The softer the funding economy, the more judiciously one should use the existing cash reserves,even at the expense of scale. A capital-efficient approach including accessing capital via bridge financing<br />before a mainstream round, can help in extending the runway as well as make companies stay relevant in the market instead of shutting shop.</p><h3>Importance of a legal team in a startup</h3><p>Startups need to be mindful of legal issues right from the very start. PE funds do not want to invest in<br />companies that are entangled in legal disputes or have material noncompliances. Legal advice becomes very vital during any fund raising process. Entrepreneurs do not always fully understand implications<br />of several clauses drafted in the legaldocumentation and are often caught with a rude shock when investors exercise their rights subsequently.</p><h3>Criteria a startup should keep in mind before onboarding an investor</h3><p>How investors evaluate startups can vary on a case-to-case basis but certain rules can be applied. Early-stage investors lay significant emphasis on the idea and team since there is limited history of financial or operating performance. The opportunity should cater to a sizeable addressable market with enough headroom for a new company to gain a meaningful market share and achieve a satisfactory IRR for the investor. It also becomes vital to exhibit that scale can be achieved in the business without compromising on profitability.</p><p><em>This article first appeared in the Indian edition of Entrepreneur magazine (May 2016 Issue).</em></p>

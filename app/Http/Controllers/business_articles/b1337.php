You're more likely to find him in tiny towns like Bristol, Tenn., foraging through other people's junk--looking for rusty, bumpy, faded gems that will fetch a healthy price for his business, Antique Archaeology. But don't let the "Antique" portion of his company's moniker mislead. This is not your doily-collecting type of antique enterprise.</p><p>You may recognize Wolfe as the head picker on History channel's <em>American Pickers</em>. He makes his living negotiating and collecting people's junk (or "man-tiques," as he prefers to call the relics). And the stuff he collects is legendary. To most undiscerning observers, a <em>Dukes of Hazzard</em> TV tray and matching lunchbox might sound like a disposable tribute to days long past. But to Wolfe, those are the kinds of treasures that surprise and delight.</p><p>In a sagging economy that smacks of a double dip, there is something poignant and appealing about Antique Archaeology. And there is something to be said for preserving some tangible parts of our unique and quirky heritage (for a price, of course). In an age defined by technology and communication, the lost art of buying and selling stuff is a refreshing bit of nostalgia.</p><p>As a business, history may seem so, um, five minutes ago--especially in immediate-gratification, frenetic, app-filled, tablet-happy techie circles. But not to <a>Mike Wolfe</a>. His approach to business is best described as old-school, grease-the-wheels negotiation. His no-BS approach has some serious teeth.</p><p>Wolfe's ability to see the possibilities and find the potential in every collectible makes him a great story. He sees things other people don't. His passion (and his TV show) is fueling renewed interest in collecting, and helping forge a lucrative new business sector for potential pickers everywhere. There is a chicness to junk--and the business opportunities and potential profits to be made are pretty chic as well.</p><p>So cheers to you, Mr. Wolfe, for showing us that history is not just the past--it's very much the present, and it's driving an abundance of opportunities for the future.</p><p><img alt="Amy C.

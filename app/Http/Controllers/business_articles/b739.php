					<p>You might know Mauricio Umansky from appearances on<em> The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</em>, because he’s married to the beautiful <a>Kyle Richards</a>. </p><p>Umansky is a high-end real estate agent, media personality and philanthropist. He was born into a life with some privilege, but the family business hit rocky roads growing up and he later ventured off on his own. </p><p></p><p>Umansky tried several businesses as he honed his entrepreneurial skills in different industries, such as textiles and fashion, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>On a date night with wife, Kyle, not too long ago, they both earned their real estate licenses and never looked back. Mauricio and his team seem to have finally hit their stride with mega-success biz <a>The Agency</a>.</p><p>Umansky and The Agency are flipping the antiquated legacy industry of real estate on its head and seriously changing the game. Umansky’s approach is very different. It’s more brand, team and client-oriented. It’s about quality of service and experience over quantity. It’s the real deal.</p><p>By shunning the traditional brokerage model of cut-throat agents competing against each other, The Agency has fostered a culture of partnership which ensures its clients and listings have the competitive edge.</p><p>This approach has proven highly successful. In less than four years, The Agency has closed more than $4.8 billion in residential sales and established itself as one of the preeminent players in the luxury real estate market, representing many of the country’s most visible and high-end properties. There were also off-camera talks about more big plans that I am keeping secret, but which will likely be announced soon. </p><p></p><p><a><em>Entrepreneur Network</em></a> <em>is a </em><a><em>premium video network</em></a><em> providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

It doesn’t matter if a video was broadcast live if you missed it and had to catch a replay.</p><p>To counter this Facebook have made some updates to the way the News Feed works when it comes to displaying Live video content.</p><p>Facebook wants to draw attention to Live video broadcasts in-the-moment, and the data appears to show that Live content will keep users attention for longer.

No matter where you are, Live lets you bring your friends, family, and followers, right next to you to experience what’s happening together.</p><p>Facebook <a>launched Live for celebrities</a> in August 2015 and gradually started rolling it out to influencers with Verified profiles before eventually opening it up to <a>all iOS users in January 2016</a>.

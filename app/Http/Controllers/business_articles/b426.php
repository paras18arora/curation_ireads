	<p>I love asking emerging entrepreneurs if they have a lead generation strategy. The typical response is: “We are bootstrapping, we can’t<em> </em>afford strategy<em>”.</em></p><p>#WhatYouAreReallySaying: “We don’t know what to do to build a strategy, and we don’t have the money to buy expensive consultants.”</p><p>The dilemma for the do-it-yourself entrepreneur is that you can’t afford t<em>o </em>waste mone<em>y</em> on the things that do not work, yet you have to get something working for you -- quickly and with little expense. What to do?</p><h2>1. Facebook news feed ads.</h2><p><a>Facebook News Feed Ads</a> are perfect if you offer a free giveaway or a lower cost product; do not “boost” or create promoted posts. These are easy to manage but not as effective. Successful ad campaigns start with a visually stunning image. Create amazing images with free tools like <a>Canva</a>, integrate a clear call to action, mention your giveaway in the image, pay special attention to the landing page<em>. </em>For example, <a>LeadPages</a> team has spent years perfecting their landing page templates.</p><p></p><h2>2. Facebook custom audience targeting.</h2><p>Rule # 1 of online marketing -- always be collecting email addresses. As long as you have at least 20 people on your email list, you can start a <a>Facebook Custom Audience</a> campaign. Select “Look Alike” targeting to find more people who are just like your customers. Its Cost Per Click (CPC) option charges only for the clicks you receive. Your $50 will go a long way.</p><h2>3. The LinkedIn sponsored update.</h2><p>Don’t ignore LinkedIn’s 600 million professional community. Experiment with <a>LinkedIn Sponsored Updates.</a> Sponsored Updates appear in the LinkedIn users' newsfeeds. They look like a regular update and are hard to miss. Publish a free article to showcase your industry expertise and deliver value to your audience. A link to a downloadable white paper is a great way to collect email addresses. Once your post is written spend the LinkedIn minimum of $10 a day to promote it. </p><p></p><h2>4. Twitter Lead Generation cards. </h2><p><a>Twitter Lead Generation cards</a> are highly effective. The main advantage of the Twitter Cards is a shorter path to receiving leads. No landing page is needed. Use <a>Tailored Audience targeting</a> to reach an email list or specific Twitter IDs.</p><p></p><p>The do-it-yourself, empty wallet entrepreneur can get a lot of lead gen strategy accomplished through social media. Trust me, it will be the best $50 you’ll ever spend.</p>

					<p>If you are serious about your crowdfunding campaign, you absolutely have to make a video.</p><p>Donâ€™t fret, though. This video won't need a Hollywood production budget. You can produce a perfectly fine video for your crowdfunding page on a budget.</p><p>The co-founder of crowdfunding platform <a>RocketHub</a>, Brian Meece, talks to us in this sixth episode of <em>Crowdfund with Cat</em> about what an effective crowdfunding video should look like. He also lays out the framework for how to produce one with limited resources.</p><p><a>RocketHub was acquired</a> by entrepreneurship resource center <a>EFactor</a> a year ago. Since then, Meece has left and is now pursuing independent projects.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><a></a>

	<p>Even when you’re trying to be inclusive, you’re bound to offend someone.</p><p>Case in point: After releasing <a>a Taiwanese commercial</a> featuring a son coming out to his father, McDonald’s angered multiple, local religious groups, according to <em><a>AdWeek.</a></em></p><p>The 90-second commercial shows the two sitting in the restaurant. Before giving a McCafe coffee cup to his dad, his son writes “I like boys” near the rim. At first, it seems the father rejects his son’s confession, slamming his fist on the table and walking away. However, the boy’s father returns with a cup on which he can write a message of his own.</p><p>“I accept you like boys,” he writes, then gives the cup to his son.</p><p></p><p>The video has since gone viral online, with more than 3 million views.</p><p>But the commercial hasn’t made every heart swell with love and pride for the duo. Unhappy with the theme, some groups such as Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family are calling for a boycott against the fast-food chain.</p><p>"Even if you want to just take a leak at a McDonald's bathroom, you can't help but feel polluted," an Alliance representative told <a>local media.</a> The rep also accused the franchise of "openly promoting gay issues" and miseducating children on sexual behavior.</p><p></p><p>Still, the alliance may be the odd man out in this case. According to a poll conducted by Taiwan’s Military of Justice, 60 percent of the country’s residents approve of same-sex marriages. The support is even mirrored by the country’s president, Tsai Ing-wen.</p><p>"In the face of love, everyone is equal. Let everyone have the freedom to love and to pursue their happiness,” she says in a <a>campaign video</a> released earlier this year.</p>

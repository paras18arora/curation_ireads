	<p>While Twitter maintains that its servers have not been hacked, the company now says it has "cross-checked" the account data noted by <a>LeakedSource</a> and is taking pre-emptive measures. Particularly notable in light of hacks that have recently affected accounts from Katy Perry to Mark Zuckerberg to the NFL, the social network said it has identified a number of accounts for extra protection.</p><p>No matter where the information came from, whether via malware or shared passwords revealed in hacks of other services, any accounts with "direct password exposure" have been locked (similar to pre-emptive moves Netflix and others are using when they see account details floating around), and emails were sent to the owner prompting for a password reset.</p><div><div><div><div><p>There's no word on exactly how many accounts in the database checked out, but Twitter told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that "millions" of accounts have been notified. If your account is vulnerable then you should've already been notified; so if your inbox is empty and you can still sign in then you don't have anything (more than usual) to worry about.</p><p>Still, it's always a good time to reset your password just in case, use unique passwords on every account (a password manager like 1Password or LastPass can be helpful) and enable two-factor authentication wherever available.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="grid@tl+ mt-n40" style="border: 0px inherit inherit; box-sizing: inherit; margin: -40px 0px 0px -40px; padding: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; font-size: 0px;"><div class="grid@tl+__cell col-8-of-12@tl+ pb-80@tp+ pb-120@d " style="border: 0px inherit inherit; box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 80px 40px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 680px; font-size: medium;"><div class="pb-35 border-top mt-20 mt-35@s pt-35 pt-30@m pt-25@s pb-25@s break-out@s" style="border-width: 1px 0px 0px; border-style: inherit; border-color: inherit; box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px 0px; padding: 35px 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;"> </div></div></div>

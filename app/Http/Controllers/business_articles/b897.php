					<p>In this video interview for the <a><em>Spartan UP!</em> podcast</a> series, Bob Roth, transcendental meditation teacher of 45 years, shares his insights on meditation and its benefits for the mind and in the workplace.</p><p>Roth has seen the practice grow from a fringe activity to a scientifically backed technique taught in schools and prisons. As Roth describes it, transcendental meditation allows you to be a better "warrior" by bringing you to a state of level-headed calm where you can make the best decisions. Meditation improves clarity and focus, eliminating negative behaviors such as impulsivity and stress-based decision making.</p><p>Roth explains that ultimately, meditation is a way to put your tumultuous highs and lows into the proper frame of reference so that you can sail easily past life’s obstacles.</p><p><em>Watch more videos from <a>Spartan UP! on their YouTube channel here</a>.</em></p><p></p><p><a><em>Entrepreneur Network</em></a> <em>is a </em><a><em>premium video network</em></a><em> providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

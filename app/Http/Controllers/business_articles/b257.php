	<p>United Continental Holdings Inc. will generate billions more dollars per year from programs including no-frills fares and expects a key revenue measure to fall less steeply in the second quarter than previously forecast, the airline said on Tuesday.</p><p>United said it expected an extra $3.1 billion in operating income per year by 2018 from the efforts, which include steps to delay fewer flights and win back corporate customers from rivals.</p><p>The company, the third-largest U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, also said passenger unit revenue would fall between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent from a year earlier. It previously forecast a decline of as much as 8.5 percent.</p><p>The announcement, along with a conference call for investors later on Tuesday, aims to outline how Chicago-based United plans to catch up to rival Delta Air Lines Inc. United has lagged Delta in on-time flights, satisfaction scores and profit margins, although its new chief executive officer has promised significant improvements.</p><p>"United's prior bench tended to duck and weave on the topic of whether its margin deficit was structural or self-inflicted," JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note on Thursday. "We expect the event to usher in a new era of transparency."</p><p>This is the first time United has disclosed a dollar figure for a planned fare class -- about $150 million by 2018 -- that is expected to not permit upgrades or advance seat assignments for those who book it. The fares will help the carrier compete with discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc.</p><p>(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)</p>

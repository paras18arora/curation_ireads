	<p>Forget 3-D. VR startup Magic Leap wants to put Star Wars directly into your living room. By that, I mean characters standing next to you and interacting with you, right in your living room.</p><p>Before you read on, you have to check out the video above. It’s wild.</p><p><a>Magic Leap</a> -- which has been in stealth mode as it develops its mixed-reality products -- said today that it is “<a>joining magical forces</a>” with Lucasfilms’ <a>ILMxLAB</a>. Lucasfilm, as you should recall, is the studio behind the Star Wars film series (Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion).</p><p>The partnership was officially announced today at the <em>Wired</em> Business Conference in New york City.</p><p></p><p>According to its website, ILMxLAB says its goal is to “reinvent the way stories are told and experienced, connecting artists with their audiences like never before.”</p><p>“We want to be a medium how to tell stories—and ultimately, maybe the medium,” Magic Leap founder Rony Abowitz told <em>Wired</em>.</p><p>That seems pretty obvious in the video above. It’s not every day you get to Netflix and chill with C-3PO and R2-D2.</p><p></p><p>It’s also obvious that Magic Leap has come a long way since 2013, when I saw people using their technology to <a>virtually slice and dice food</a> playing Fruit Ninja at SXSW.</p><p>Whatever is up their sleeve, may the magic, or Force, be with Magic Leap.</p>

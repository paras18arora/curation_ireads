					<p><a>Devialet</a>’s line of impossibly great-sounding <a>Phantom speakers</a> has earned “Best of CES” awards from the likes of <em>Wired</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>USA Today</em>. And with good reason. These things produce sound that is so incredibly clear and awesomely loud that audiophiles have been moved to tears in its presence.</p><p>Devialet brought its latest offering, the 4.500 Watt, 108 dB <a>Phantom Gold</a>, to <em>Entrepreneur’s </em>New York office. A warning to audiophiles: invest in a new box of Kleenex before you give it a listen. With a $2,990 price tag, it is not exactly cheap, but the sound that comes out of it truly is gold. Upon pressing play, our CRO’s desk instantly became the front row of an Eagles concert at Madison Square Garden. The sound was sharp, clean and, wow, was it loud. You could feel the notes vibrating through your body. Even if you feel like you’ve heard “Hotel California” a million times before, you never heard it like this before.</p><p></p><p>It is hard to describe the immense sound that comes out of this 10-inch-tall wonder, which is why Devialet offered Phantoms to key tech and innovation influencers such as Andy Rubin, Tony Fadell, Marc Benioff, Palmer Luckey and Reid Hoffman to help spread the word. Most people who hear, the company says, has an immediate need to call all of their friends and say, “You need to check this out today!” It was was true of these tech titans as well, as you can see from tweets such as <a>this</a>.</p><p>Some specs on the little music maker to satisfy your nerdiest music need-to-knows:<img alt="" src="https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1467305302_Phantom Gold - Tech Specs (1).jpg" style="height:1753px; width:1240px" /></p>

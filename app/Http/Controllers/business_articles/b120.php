	<p>Muhammad Ali didn’t just float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, he also lost 3 and a half prime years of his career while fighting the <a>draft</a> as doggedly as he did Sonny Liston. He controversially converted to Islam at a time when most Americans didn’t even know what that was (<a>but they knew they didn’t like it</a>) and even raised the roof by way of talking a suicidal jumper <a>off of one</a>.</p><p>The man did a lot. With his fists and with his mouth. Born as Cassius Clay, his mesmerizing ability to fight with wars with his words could best be described as <a>flow</a> years before hip hop was even a thing. And his talent was so titanic that, well,<em> Titanic</em> up and plagiarized the self-described “<a>king of the world</a>”.  Hell, the real life super hero even negotiated the release of <a>American hostages</a> in Iraq!</p><p></p><p>Last night Ali passed away due to respiratory issues, surrounded by family at a Phoenix area hospital, at the age of 74. Here are some of the most memorable words spoken and shouted by this incredible fighter and activist. RIP, GOAT.</p><h2> </h2><h2>On Achieving Greatness</h2><p>“If they can make penicillin out of moldy bread, they can sure make something out of you.”</p><p> </p><h2>On Aging</h2><p>“A man who views the world the same at 50 as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.”</p><p></p><h2> </h2><h2>On Fortitude</h2><p>“It isn’t the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it’s the pebble in your shoe.”</p><p><img alt="" src="https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1465429993_ali-2.png" /></p><div class="courtesy">Image credit: Stanley Weston | Getty Imagese</div><p> </p><h2>On Preparation</h2><p>“If my mind can conceive it, and my heart can believe it—then I can achieve it.”</p><p> </p><h2>On Golf</h2><p>"I'm the best. I just haven't played yet."</p><p> </p><h2>On Regret</h2><p>"Turning my back on Malcolm X was one of the mistakes I regret most in my life. I wish I'd been able to tell Malcolm I was sorry."</p><p> </p><h2>On Race</h2><p>“The Nation Of Islam taught that white people are devils. I don’t believe that now; in fact, I never really believed that.”</p><p> </p><h2>On Being Humble</h2><p>“At home I am a nice guy: but I don’t want the world to know. Humble people, I’ve found, don’t get very far.”</p><p> </p><h2>On His Achievements</h2><p>“I’ve wrestled with alligators; I’ve tussled with a whale; I done handcuffed lightning; and throw thunder in jail.”</p><p> </p><h2>On Victory</h2><p>“The will must be stronger than the skill.”</p><p> </p><h2>On Payback</h2><p>“You kill my dog, you better hide your cat."</p><p> </p><h2>On Dreams</h2><p>"If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

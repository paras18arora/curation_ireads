	<p>A considerable part of your brand is expressed in your bio, or on the <em>About</em> page of your web site.</p><p>Does your bio tell a story? Or does it read like a resume?</p><p>Take some risks and put your heart out there when writing your bio.</p><h2></h2><p>Telling a story with your bio may not apply to biochemical research professionals, but I’m addressing entrepreneurs who aspire to be thought-leaders. You must create memorable connections with your constituents in order to cut through the noise of popular culture.</p><p></p><div class="rt-elem-show" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; float: right; width: 300px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: Lato, arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><div class="rt-elem-np" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; clear: both; float: right; width: 300px;"> </div></div><h2></h2><p>What’s the romantic version of your early days? The lean years? The time between jobs? Your youthful ignorance? How did those days shape you?</p><p>I’m giving you poetic license to tell your story in your bio, web site, blogs, videos, and social media.</p><h2></h2><p>What’s something about you, or an experience, that isn’t necessarily “bio” material but might give insight into your personal quirkiness?</p><p></p><p>If a sense of humor is a part of how you operate, I dare you to share it. If you’re a nerd, let your geek flag fly!</p><p>If this is new for you, start storytelling in your bio conservatively, and then push the boundaries… slowly.</p><h2></h2><p>Can we turn “failures” into tales of epic adventure? You bet.</p><p>Consider being transparent, and share how unexpected events and course corrections made you more capable in your business. In other words, quit trying to portray yourself as a flawless genius.</p><p>Share your successes, too! And be sure to credit others for their part in your story.</p><h2></h2><p>If you are in your happy place in your current venture, alert your <em>About</em> page! Let others sense the energy you feel in your work.</p><p>When others read your bio, do they get a sense of the road you’ve traveled? Real people tell stories and share their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Once you've updated your bio and <em>About </em>page, use the new text to create better social media profiles.</p><p>In our noisy culture, people are eager to connect with a real person.</p>

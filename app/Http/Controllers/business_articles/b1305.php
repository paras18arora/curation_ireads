	<p>Move over Easter Bunny, McDonald’s is about to deliver some stiff competition with its Cadbury Creme Egg McFlurry.</p><p>The fast food franchise announced the festive addition to the menu in a <a>press release</a>, describing it as  "a delicious mouthful of chocolate pieces and Crème Egg topping, blended into a creamy soft serve."</p><p></p><p>But don’t get too excited about the creation, unless you live in Australia. Sadly, that’s the only country where the Easter-themed treat will be available. However, the swirly surprise was apparently available in England back in 2009, according to<a> Serious Eats</a>.</p><p></p><p>So, there’s still a chance. Right?</p>

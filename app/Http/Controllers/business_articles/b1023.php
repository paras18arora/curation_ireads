	<p>In 2015 Nootrobox was flying high from stories about its flagship product -- a pill supplement called RISE designed to enhance cognitive performance -- that appeared in a series of media outlets such as <em>The New York Observer</em>. Not even a year old, the San Francisco-based startup had the kind of marketing boost every company dreams of. Then it ran out of product. </p><p>“We were very excited about the press coverage, which blew orders through the roof,” recounts founder and COO Michael Brandt. “We had pulled the trigger on a purchase order to replenish supply and tried to get our supplier to move faster when the press stuff happened. But you can’t just snap your fingers and get a product like ours made faster.”</p><p>That meant almost a thousand new and existing customers weren’t going to get their orders filled anytime soon. Here was a company whose products claim to promote mental acuity, showing its customer base a clear lack of exactly that with a faulty demand forecast. “We felt like it would undercut our entire brand if we didn’t roll up our sleeves and try to mend these relationships,” Brandt says. </p><p>But rather than dump the problem on their customer service staff, Brandt and his cofounder, Geoffrey Woo, grabbed the hot seat themselves and started contacting customers personally.</p><p>“We decided we could do the best job of repairing [customer] relationships by answering their questions one by one,” Brandt says. “It took half our day, every day, for several weeks to do it, but I think we succeeded in getting people to understand the processes we have to follow to make our products and that we weren’t going to compromise quality just to ship faster.”</p><p>After about 1,000 personal emails and phone calls, they managed to salvage all but a handful of customers. “The conversations turned from a cold, ‘Where’s my product?’ to excitement and curiosity about our products,” says Brandt, who is convinced the unorthodox crisis-communications campaign saved the company.</p><p>“Conservatively I’d say saving those 1,000 customers was worth at least $50,000 in revenue, and likely a whole lot more in recurring revenue. That was a very important $50,000, because soon after we resolved this situation, we were able to raise $2 million in VC money that we otherwise might not have been able to raise.” </p><h2>Read about more unconvenal decisions that paid off <a>here</a>.</h2>

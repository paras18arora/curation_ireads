	<p>I haven’t talked about playing handball on <a>The School of Greatness</a> in a while. That’s because I admittedly took some time off while I was focusing on my book launch and getting some new projects off the ground.</p><p>But this week I’m taking off to train with my team and then play in the Pan American championships in Buenos Aires next week.</p><p>I’m really excited. And not just because I get to play handball again.</p><p>It’s because playing sports has been such a big part of my life and it’s something that I’ve often thought might be over for me.</p><p>But it’s not. I keep getting opportunities to play the sports I love on a big scale. And it’s because I keep devoting my time, energy, and belief into my dreams.</p><p><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/267236017&color=358cb4" width="100%"></iframe></p><p>Subscribe on <a>iTunes</a>, <a>Stitcher Radio</a>, <a>Google Play</a> or <a>TuneIn</a></p>

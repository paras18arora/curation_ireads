	<p>I have worked in PR my whole career. In college, I held a position at <a>Ogilvy PR</a>, and after graduating, I formed my own <a>firm</a>. So I have spent considerable time in the industry on both the business development and account management sides.</p><p></p><p>And along the way, the biggest pain point I've observed plaguing public relations is the dearth of KPIs, metrics and analytics to drive campaigns and inform smart decision-making and iteration. The development of the <a>Barcelona Principles</a> is a good starting point, but traditional PR must become more data focused to yield better results and compete against other marketing disciplines.</p><h2></h2><p>With the explosion of digital marketing this past decade, chief marketing officers have become exposed to tremendous troves of data and are taking advantage of the information available to them.</p><p>Between Google Analytics and hundreds of other marketing intelligence and analytics dashboards, companies can now get tremendously drilled-down valuable insights as to where their dollars are most effective, which demographics are most interested and more.</p><p>Obtaining customers via digital marketing is a dollars-and-cents (sense) science. Anyone can easily tie marketing events to outcomes and shift efforts toward what is working best.</p><p>The traditional PR discipline, on the other hand is much more qualitatively driven. It might be considered more of an art than a science, and it lacks quantitative ROI measurement. While there is a “magic factor” to getting a cover story in the <em>New York Times</em> or <em>Forbes --</em> which can change the trajectory of a business and is hard to quantify in terms of exact impact -- PR professionals can and must think of creative ways to measure outcomes in a more quantitative way.</p><h2></h2><p>I believe it's irresponsible for a PR professional to try to quantitatively measure ROI from a great story or collection of stories secured in the days, weeks or even months following a publication date (or dates). Why? Even a year, or even two or three years, after a great <em>Wall Street Journal</em> story published about company X, a potential customer, investor, hire or other stakeholder might come across that article, be impressed and take action. This could lead to a positive outcome long after the article actually appeared.</p><p></p><p>I believe the solution is to look at past outcomes in the aggregate, which can inform what may be expected as a result of the specific PR activities performed.</p><p>Those expectations should be communicated to the client so that when a decision is made regarding whether to spend on traditional PR versus SEO or digital ads, data is available that makes an argument for why dollars should go toward the former.</p><h2></h2><p>Additional data sources, such as clients' site traffic, should be leveraged in order to paint a broader picture of business outcomes resulting from specific PR activities.</p><p></p><p>Bringing quantitative measurement and prediction of outcomes to traditional PR will grow transparency and trust between agencies and clients, and inform better decision-making and, ultimately, results. To compete in today’s data-driven world, the traditional PR industry must move forward in its ability to measure and analyze outcomes as a result of PR.</p>

As of May 16, crowdfunding is becoming more democratic on the investor side, too.</p><p>Equity crowdfunding, in which entrepreneurs raise cash by selling a piece of their company, has historically only been open to accredited investors, or those investors who meet certain levels of wealth.

Anyone with the cash and the interest will be able to invest in startups.</p><p>Hillel-Tuch walks us through what the change means and how it will affect the startup finance landscape. Â </p><p><a>RocketHub was acquired</a> by entrepreneurship resource center <a>EFactor</a> a year ago. Since then, Hillel-Tuch has left and is now a partner at the venture building group, <a>Stacked VB</a>.</p><p>For more on the rule change and how entrepreneurs and investors should prepare, check out our series of written stories on equity crowdfunding (linked to below).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

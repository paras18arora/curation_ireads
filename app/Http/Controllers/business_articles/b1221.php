	<p>What do <a>urns</a>, <a>fruit</a> and <a>drones</a> have in common?</p><p>All of these are products fall under the massive <a><em>Star Wars</em></a><em> </em>licensing umbrella that raked in over <a>$3 billion in 2015</a> and is estimated to bring in <a>$5 billion this year</a>. The film franchise, which Disney purchased from <em>Star Wars</em> creator George Lucas in 2012 for the bargain price (relatively speaking) of $4 billion, has the largest licensing program ever, says Karina Masolova, editor of <em><a>The Licensing Letter</a>. </em></p><p>“Disney is exporting a huge world,” Masolova says. “Name a product, and they probably have it.”</p><p>It’s no shocker that <em>Star Wars</em> alone is doing billions in merchandise sales. George Lucas’s first film kicked off in 1977, and today, total revenue from <em>Star Wars</em> toy licensing is <a>estimated at $12 billion</a> and counting.  </p><p>The excitement is not going away anytime soon. The next film, <em>Rogue One</em>, will debut Dec. 16, 2016. In honor of <a><em>Star Wars</em> Day</a> (<a>#MayTheFourthBeWithYou</a>), enjoy some fun facts about <em>Star Wars</em> sales figures over the years.</p><div><p><em>Note: While box-office totals have been adjusted for inflation, other sales numbers from the past four decades may not be. Given the range of estimates out there, the following figures provide a sense of the franchise’s scope.</em></p><p><a></a></p><ul><li><p>The first film in the franchise,<em> A New Hope</em>, debuted in 1977 and has generated <a>$3 billion in sales</a> since.</p></li><li><p>The seventh installment, <a><em>The Force Awakens</em></a>, was released on Dec. 18, 2016 and had the highest earning opening box office sales of all time at $248 million.

(Some estimates put the figure even higher!)</p></li><li><p>The one film that did not match the merchandising sales of the others was <em>Attack of the Clones. </em>Because of the massive unpopularity of the Jar Jar Binks character, sales suffered.</p></li><li><p><a>Force Friday</a> is an 18-hour global sales marathon -- much like Black Friday -- pegged to the launch of new <em>Star Wars</em> toys.

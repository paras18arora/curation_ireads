	<p>I come from a long line of employees. My father worked in the maintenance department at <a>Belmont Park Racetrack</a>. He wore a green laborer’s uniform every day. My mother stayed at home raising five children and waited tables at night to supplement his income.</p><p>No one in my family owned a business. They were all employed by someone else. As a little girl, I didn’t even realize that you could own a business!</p><p></p><p>As an adult, I was initially employed as a secretary. Years later, I became an emergency room doctor. Physicians in private practice owned their own business, but I was employed by the hospital. I wore blue scrubs instead of a green uniform -- but I was an employee just like my father. When I left mainstream medicine at age 50 to open a medical spa dedicated to helping women age without surgery, I became the first entrepreneur in my family.</p><p>I thought my new business would be an extension of my old job. I would still go to work and take care of people, but now I would be working for myself. It would be different -- but not that different. I was in for a big surprise.</p><p>Now, I had to do more than just take care of people. Not only did my patients need to be nurtured, but my business needed to be nurtured as well. Before I could become a successful entrepreneur, I needed to change the way I thought about work.</p><p>I spent my years as an ER doctor giving things away. I gave you my undivided attention, I worked tirelessly to solve your problem, I handled your feelings with great care, and as you were leaving, I filled up a bag with supplies so you would be more comfortable at home. As an entrepreneur, things were different. The first time I had to look into someone’s face and say, “That will be $100,” I cringed.</p><p>Fifteen years later, I have a profitable business that does good work and brings me great joy. I was able to develop a different way to look at work.</p><p>Here are a few lessons I learned along my journey. If you are planning a transition or are new to the world of <a>entrepreneurship</a>, maybe they will help you too.</p><p></p><h2></h2><p>When I first opened my business, I thought I would be up and running within six months. I wasn’t prepared for the uphill battle, the sleepless nights, the anxiety and the humiliation of potential failure.  </p><p>Over the years, I learned that everyone struggles -- but not everyone shares their struggle. The temptation in starting a new business is to compare yourself with others in your field. Maybe they really are as successful as they sound, but maybe it’s bravado.</p><p>Early in my career, I would go to networking events. Someone would always ask, “How’s business?” I made a conscious decision to tell the truth. “It could be better.” It took less energy for me to let people know I was struggling than to pretend I had it all figured out. It didn’t mean I was failing. That honesty opened the door for others to share their struggles as well.</p><h2></h2><p>It’s important to define exactly who you are and what you want from your business. At the beginning, I tried to be everything to everyone. I would compare what I offered to other businesses and finally realized I was contorting myself to fit someone else’s business model.</p><p>When I decided that I didn’t want to compete on a larger scale, things fell into place. I have simplified my offerings, but deliver consistent quality. I treat people the way I would want to be treated. I worked harder at the beginning, but have now cut my hours to three days a week. I don’t work weekends or evenings. I have never lost a patient to scheduling, and I guarantee you won’t lose any clients either. If you do right by your client, they will find a way to get to you.</p><h2></h2><p>Within three months of opening my business, I was running out of money and was operating from a position of fear. If someone made a fuss about the price of a service, I would immediately lower my price. If they couldn’t come during my working hours, I came in earlier or stayed later to accommodate them.</p><p>The turning point came when I sat at the<a> spa</a> for 11 hours to accommodate two women who needed early-morning and late-evening appointments -- and neither one showed up. I was humiliated and angry. I went home and secured loans from family and friends to see me through the start-up process.</p><p>Then, I honored my business decisions. If you’re operating from a position of financial fear, do what needs to be done to give yourself a cushion -- barter with someone, borrow from family and friends. Don’t wait until you’re sitting alone for 11 hours to honor yourself.</p><p></p><p>Transitioning from employee to entrepreneur is an exciting time, with many new <a>adventures </a>ahead. There will be joyous days and days when it’s all just too much. On those days, breathe out, navigate the struggle and put yourself on the list. Now go build a business!</p>

					<p>"If you're not marketing, you don't have a business."  </p><p>Josh Weidman, head trainer at <a>REI 360</a>, recently coined this phrase -- and to Chris Haddon and Jason Balin, co-founders of Columbia, M.D.-based lending and real-estate companies <a>Hard Money Bankers</a> and <a>REI 360</a>, truer words have never been spoken. </p><p>"There's really no excuse not to do marketing," Balin says in this video. </p><p>The best marketing is about being consistent and building up slowly before becoming a black belt at it -- that way you won't get overwhelmed. </p><p>"The internet is changing on an hourly, daily basis," Balin says. "Things that were relevant in SEO world a few years ago are not anymore. Social is changing constantly ... you don't have to do everything. Just pick two or three things that you're comfortable doing -- and just get started and do them."</p><p>Click play for more online marketing strategies. </p><p><em>Watch more videos from the folks at <a>REI 360 on their YouTube channel here</a>.</em></p><p></p><p><a><em>Entrepreneur Network</em></a> <em>is a </em><a><em>premium video network</em></a><em> providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

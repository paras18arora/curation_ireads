	<p>The travel industry is very lucrative. How lucrative? The <a data-mce-href="https://www.ustravel.org/answersheet">U.S. Travel Association</a> states that U.S. travelers spend an average of “$2.6 billion a day, $108.1 million an hour, $1.8 million a minute and $30,033 a second” on travel. Overall traveling, generates a whooping $2.1 trillion in economic activity -- $947.1 billion in direct travel expenditures that spurred an additional $1.2 trillion in other industries.</p><p>So, how much does a vacation really cost a traveler? The travel site <a>Hipmunk</a> put together a handy <a data-mce-href="https://www.hipmunk.com/tailwind/hipmunk-travel-smackdown-disneyland-vs-disney-world/#.VzIogHErLnB">infographic</a> that gives us a pretty good idea by examining the cost involved for a family of four visiting Disney.</p><p>The average cost to visit either Disneyworld or Disneyland ranges between $3,227 to $4,954. Surprisingly, that falls in the average range of what we spend on vacations annually -- $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four.</p><p>Even college students looking for a quick escape during Spring Break can expect to easily spend <a data-mce-href="http://www.cbsnews.com/media/the-cheapest-and-priciest-spring-break-destinations/4/">around $1,000</a>. For example, heading to Hollywood, Florida would cost approximately $1,132. This includes $298 for a six-night hotel stay, $374 for airfare and taxis, and $460 for food and drinks.</p><p>Looking at data collected and shared by <a data-mce-href="http://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-vacation">ValuePenguin</a> and <a data-mce-href="http://stuffedsuitcase.com/average-vacation-cost/">Stuffed Suitcase</a>, we spend between $4,000 to $4,700 each year thanks to following expenses.</p><h2 bitstream="" new="" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, " times="">Transportation</h2><p>The <a data-mce-href="http://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2010/travel/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> writes that the “largest travel expense was for transportation, which represented 44 percent of the total amount spent. ” In fact, most households spend an average of $2,100 annually for vacation transportation costs.</p><p>Of course, transportation costs can vary throughout the year depending on the modes of transportation and <a data-mce-href="https://blog.mint.com/saving/12-money-saving-tips-for-a-more-affordable-vacation-part-ii-of-iii-on-vacation-budgeting/">when you’re traveling</a>. Booking an airline ticket during summer breaks and holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas tend to be more expensive than traveling during the off-season. In that case, it’s <a data-mce-href="https://www.cheapair.com/blog/travel-tips/when-to-buy-airline-tickets-based-on-1-5-billion-airfares/">suggested</a> that you purchase your airline tickets sooner than later.</p><p>With that in mind, the average transportation cost ranges between between $224 to $1,755 depending mainly where you’re traveling to and the distance involved. So, a train ticket from Philadelphia to Washington D.C, could fall between<a data-mce-href="https://www.wanderu.com/en/train-tickets/us-pa/philadelphia/us-dc/washington-dc/"> $9 to $54</a> each way if taking a bus. However, a <a data-mce-href="https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/Philadelphia-PHL/Los-Angeles-LAX">flight from Philly to Los Angeles</a> could be as low as under $300 to as high as $700 round trip.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of the annual vacation transportation costs spent on travel.</p><ul><li>Airline - $3,304</li><li>Buses between cities - $252</li><li>Trains between cities - $521</li><li>Local transportation on out-of-town trips - $202</li><li>Taxis/car service on out-of-town trips - $119</li><li>Ships - $2,456</li><li>Gas for out-of-town trips - $669</li><li>Parking for out-of-town trips - $172</li><li>Tolls for out-of-town trips - $71</li></ul><p>Since actually getting to your destination eats up most of your transportation you can use this handy calculator from <a data-mce-href="http://www.travelmath.com/">Travelmath</a> to help you decide whether it’s cheaper to fly or drive on your next vacation.</p><p></p><h2 bitstream="" new="" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, " times="">Lodging</h2><p>The average lodging cost per trip is around $150 per night. Again, depending on where you’re staying and when you’re traveling that cost can fluctuate. For example, staying in a downtown hotel is generally going to be more expensive than staying in the outskirts of a city.</p><p>Thanks to sites like Airbnb, there are now more affordable lodging options. In most cases <a data-mce-href="https://www.busbud.com/blog/airbnb-vs-hotel-rates/">Airbnb is cheaper than hotels</a>. For example, if you visited Toronto, it would cost you at least $148 for a hotel room, but $89 through Airbnb.</p><p>You can also cut down your lodging costs by not traveling on the weekends or during holidays. Also, look into discounts through coupon sites like LivingSocial or by signing-up for hotel reward programs. Also keep in mind that <a data-mce-href="https://due.com/payments">payments</a> in some countries charge up to 5% surcharge on lodging paid with credit cards.</p><p></p><h2 bitstream="" new="" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, " times="">Food and drinks.</h2><p>We spend on average $33 on food per day. If you prepare your own food, however, that amount could drop to just $6. International travelers typically spend more, approximately $35 per day per person. Those meals can get pricey if you add alcoholic beverages like beer and wine. How much more? Around another $380 in expenses.</p><p>Besides your three main meals, don’t forget about any snacks and drinks in-between meals, as well tips and taxes that you’ll have to include. Kimberly from the Stuffed Suitcases plans to budget around $100 per day on food - $20 for breakfast, $30 for lunch, $50 for dinner, and another $10 for snacks.</p><p>If you have lodging that comes equipped with a kitchen you can save a lot of money by purchasing your own groceries and cooking some of your own meals.</p><p>One way to save is to find hotels with a breakfast included, or try eating a dish of cereal in your room, make sandwiches for lunch - then eat out somewhere great for dinner. Or, eat a great dinner at lunch, since it will cost less in the middle of the day, and just grab a pizza later for dinner.</p><p></p><h2 bitstream="" new="" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, " times="">Entertainment.</h2><p>Travelers use their vacation time to participate in cultural activities and special activities, such as visiting a museum, theatre, theme park, or sporting events. Domestically, we spend roughly $52 for and $293 internationally for entertainment. Of course, that amount can vary depending on how many people are traveling and where you are vacationing. For example, a one-day pass at Disney World’s Magic Kingdom costs around $105 per adult ticket. In other cities, however, you can visit a museum for free.</p><p>If you want to save some money on entertainment, do your research in advance. You may be able to take advantage of package deals, such as a museum pass in Paris that allows you entrance into 50 of the city’s museums from anywhere between 12 to 21 Euro per day. You can even do a search for any free events taking place in your destination when you’re there.</p><p>Check with your hotel, they often have brochures with local events listed and usually the person at the front desk has some great suggestions for activities.</p><h2 bitstream="" new="" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, " times="">Taxes.</h2><p>One of the most overlook costs that can incur during a vacation are taxes. Take for example a hotel stay during a trip to New York City. You’ll be faced with “Hotel Room Occupancy Tax Rate (5.875%); New York State Sales Tax and New York City Sales Tax (combined rate of 8.875%) and the New York State Hotel Unit Fee ($1.50 per unit per day).”</p><p>If you’re flying and your ticket costs more than $300 you’ll be subject to federal taxes and fees that can increase your ticket by another 20%. And, depending where you’re traveling, you could have expensive taxes on food and drinks and activities.</p><p>There’s no way in getting around taxes, but you should at least do your research in advance so that you can budget accordingly. There are also many <a data-mce-href="https://due.com/blog/101-work-from-home-jobs/">side jobs</a> you can pick up to help you save a little extra cash.</p><p>Taking a vacation can get expensive, but don’t let that deter from traveling. If you plan your trip in advance, set-up a dedicated savings account for your trip, and do your homework, you can get the most bang for your buck the next time you travel.</p>
